^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use advanced statistics and if you are using a version between
0.3.0 and 0.4.2 you :underline:`need` to update your database after
installing this version. Click on the “Extension manager” at the “My
quiz and poll” extension and select the “UPDATE!” menu point. Finally
click at the “Start”-button.

:underline:`Note` : if have seen some cache-problems. If you think
there is something wrong after the update, please check all your quiz
/poll-flexforms and save them again. If you think, there is still
something wrong, remove this extension and install it again. Make a
backup of the tx\_myquiz\*-tables, if you want to use an older version
again.

Optional update 1: convert basic poll data to advanced poll data.

Optional update 2: convert basic poll data to voting data.
