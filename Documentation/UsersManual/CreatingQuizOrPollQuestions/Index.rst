Click on “Create a new record” in the SysFolder and then click on the
green image with the question mark:

|img-10|

*Image 7: Record types*

You should get a “Quiz Question” creation/edition window. Now you can
create a new question.Parts of a question: title; name; type; up to 6
answers; for every answer you can decide, if it is a correct answer;
explanation; scores for each correct answer, an image and some more
things.If you upload an image, the image will be displayed in the left
column of a table and the question on the right column (can be changed
via template). Currently you can choose only between 6 types of
questions. Even in the text verification (input-field) case you should
check (enable) the correct?-check-box number 1.

For each question you can provide an explanation that will be
presented to the quiz taker along with her results and the correct
answers.

You can add as many questions as you wish to your quiz SysFolder. You
will find 4 Quiz/Poll elements:Questions: you will see the titles of
the questions.Answers/results: you will see the name of a quiz/poll
taker. If you edit one of the records you will see the
results.Relations: you will see a UID. This is a relation between
result and question.Categories: you will see the name of the category.
