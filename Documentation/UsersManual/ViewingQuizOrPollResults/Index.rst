Viewing quiz or poll results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the List-view you can see the name, email, homepage and ip-address
of a quiz/poll taker.Furthermore you can see which question(s) (uid's)
the quiz/poll taker has viewed and you can see how much scores the
quiz taker has accomplished. That is the value, which will be shown in
the highscore list. If the extension is configured as a poll, this
field shows, which answer of the question the poll taker has selected.

Use the backend module for more and better outputs. You will find it
on the left side under the Web folder. Select something from the right
menu:
