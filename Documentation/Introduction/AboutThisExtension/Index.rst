About this extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I began to write this extension in April 2008 at the university of
Bonn. The intention was to create a TYPO3 program that generates
multiple choice questions like in the exam. That was the reason why I
joined the TYPO3 practical training.

This extension is today not state of the art. I recommend to use a
newer extension...
